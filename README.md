SugarCubes
==========

Processing sketch to run the SugarCubes art car. Requires Processing 1.5, does not run on version 2.0. Open the sketch in Processing and find instructions there. No library installations should be required.

If you have git installed, simply run: https://github.com/mcslee/SugarCubes.git

Alternatively, download the ZIP from GitHub and expand. Note that the folder will be called "SugarCubes-master." You must rename this to just "SugarCubes" for it to open properly.
